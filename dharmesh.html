	<h2>Hi Dharmesh</h2>
	<p> 
		Thanks for coming over to take a look. Below is a explanation video and the link to the app itself.

	<p>The app: <a href="https://lexoomail.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"> https://lexoomail.herokuapp.com/</a></p>

	<p><br>Also, I saw that FP was looking to hire a Head of Marketing and Growth Hacker, but didnâ€™t fill the second position. That role is exactly what I have in mind and I hope you believe such a person could add value. </p>
	<p>

	</p>

	<p>I could bridge the marketing and development functions by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>taking pressure off front-end devs by doing the simpler jobs, especially when it comes to running AB tests. 
		</li>
		<li>helping companies run their marketing campaigns.
		</li>
		<li>analysing data. 
		</li>
		<li>building in-house marketing tech. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please feel free to look at a couple of other <a href="/work.html" target="_blank">projects</a> I've done. And you can get a sense of my background from my <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/gregaubert" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile.</p>
	<p>Thanks again for stopping by. I hope we can schedule a meeting from July 22'nd onwards. </p>
