<!-- 		<h2>COVID-19 UPDATE - 22/08/21</h2>
		<p>
			<h3>STILL CLOSED</h3><br>

			As I have the medical condition ME or chronic fatigue syndrome that puts me in the vulnerable group. Therefore I have reluctantly decided to remain closed for repairs until the data from the results of the pathway steps consistently indicates that the virus has been at least subdued. To be honest it is beginning to look as though it will be some time yet before that happens. <br><br>
		The risk of hospitalisation and ultimately death has been greatly reduced thanks to the vaccines. However the threat of Long Covid remains. The symptoms of ME/CFS are strikingly similar to Long Covid so I can say that you should do all you can to avoid  catching this virus.<br><br>
		Please take care,<br><br>
		Regards Arthur Aubert<br><br><br>
		Please refer to this website for any updates to the situation.

		<p>Although I like to be on first name terms with my customers, please sign off with <strong><u>your full name</u></strong> to avoid any confusion!</p><br> -->

		<p>For your convenience, I operate outside of typical 9-5 working hours. This means I'm available (by appointment) for customers to drop off and collect their guitars in the evenings/weekends. As a result, I cannot guarantee I'll always be available to answer calls - so <u>text message</u> is by far the best way to reach me. </p><br>
