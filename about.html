	<h2>About</h2>

	<p>
		Since January 2015, I've been learning web development with the <a href="http://foundersandcoders.org" target="_blank">Founders & Coders organisation</a> in East London. I believe that to be effective in digital businesses, it really helps to have a technical understanding. Even better if you know enough to create things yourself. I was frustrated with my lack of coding knowledge, so I set out to do something about it. Do check out <a href="http://foundersandcoders.org/apply.html" target="_blank"> the course</a> if any of that resonated with you.

	<p>
		Before that I took part in the <a href="http://newentrepreneursfoundation.com/" target="_blank"> New Entrepreneurs Foundation </a> cohort of 2014 .
	<br>
		The Foundation is creating a new generation of entrepreneurs who will play a role in Britain’s future growth and create new market-leading businesses.
	<br>
		A highly selective group of the UK’s 30 brightest and most entrepreneurially minded young people were chosen to get hands-on experience, skills and networks to build scalable businesses.

		Previously, I worked in Investment Banking, started an events business, lead a sales team for a startup and got an Economics Bsc from the University of Bath.
